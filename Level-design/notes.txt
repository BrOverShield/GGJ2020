MC = main character

Menu (broken):
	Menu items are:
		optionS
			change font size?
			any other game options
		moAr
			drop-down that reveals "creds" and "a boot"
		cReds
			credits
		a booT
			summons a boot that kicks away all the letters except for the capitalized ones (not actually capitalized in the game, this is just a representation for these notes)
	
	Need to drag and drop an S T A R and T to spell out START, to click that and start the game
	

Level 1 puzzle brainstorm:
	~~interact with environment (i.e. flip switches)~~
	~~repair switches so that MC can flip them~~
	assemble things out of schematics to repair game mechanics
	move objects to reach platforms/ledges
	~~repair 2D cart to carry something somewhere~~
	
	
Level 1: purely 2D
	At this point, essentially everything is broken:
		bad sound
		bad lighting
			wireframe view, no colour
		can't jump
		no gravity for MC / bosses / objects
		
	area to right is blocked off by what seems to be a wall, so can only go left
	
	go left, repair wireframe view
		get this automatically? Might be hard to figure out what to do, when seeing everything as wireframes
	
	"stairwell" section - map drops down a level, and there's also an overhanging upper level to jump to (except MC can't jump right now!)
		gravity is broken, so MC maintains same height and keeps walking left in mid-air
			repair gravity - MC falls into pit below
			
		there's a broken ladder in the pit - need to grab the two pieces and place them against the wall
		
		climb up left side of pit:
			repair jumping
				use the boot again here?
			
		can't go further left (wall); go back right, jump into pit, move ladder, climb up right side
		
		repair sound
			3D walkman schematic
		
		jump back up the stairwell to starting height, then jump up and left onto the overhanging upper level
	
	some classic platforming/jumping
		level collapsing, and need to repair it?
	
	repair first axis and unlock 2.5D mode
	
	have colour mechanic hidden behind fake wall up here, visible from where 2.5D mode was unlocked?
		walked right past it in 2D mode because it looked like part of the background
	
	return back to starting area
		make it obvious to go back here, so players don't just get lost!
		maybe we can see the boss door in the distance from here?
		

Level 1 boss:
	by rotating planes, can see the "wall" blocking right of the starting area is actually just a door with no walls around it - MC can just walk around its
	
	FIGURE OUT BOSS MECHANICS!
		should involve rotating planes, possibly activating/moving lasers on both planes to corner/kill the boss?
		or assemble a cart and push it to knock the boss over, which knocks it out
	
	after boss fight, teleporting to space no longer makes sense if we want to use the environment/gravity to kill the last boss
		build(/repair) bridge out of boss parts to next area? 
	
	
Level 2: 2.5 D
	use similar puzzle mechanics from level 1, but add in plane-rotation as a requirement to solve all puzzles
