MC = main character

Menu (broken):
	Menu items are:
		optionS
			change font size?
			any other game options
		moAr
			drop-down that reveals "creds" and "a boot"
		cReds
			credits
		a booT
			summons a boot that kicks away all the letters except for the capitalized ones (not actually capitalized visually, this is just a representation for these notes)
	
	Need to drag and drop an S T A R and T to spell out START, to click that and start the game
	

Level 1: purely 2D
	At this point, essentially everything is broken:
		bad sound
		bad lighting?
			wireframe view, no colour, etc.
		can't jump
		can't grab objects
		no gravity for MC / bosses / objects
		
	area to right is blocked off by what seems to be a wall, so can only go left
	
	go left, repair sound and/or lighting
		depending on how these are restored, MAY NEED ABILITY TO GRAB BLOCKS/OBJECTS FIRST!
			just have to hit button to get lighting?
			have to pick up button and put it in place to get sound?
	
	"stairwell" section - map drops down a level, and there's also an overhanging upper level to jump to (except MC can't jump right now!)
		gravity is broken, so MC maintains same height and just keeps walking left in mid-air
			repair gravity - MC falls to ground below and can't go right because there are ledges and they still can't jump
		
		keep going left, repair jumping
		
		need a wall to prevent going further left
		
		jump back up the stairwell to starting height, then jump up and left
	
	some classic platforming/jumping
		level collapsing a bit, and need to repair it?
	
	repair first axis and unlock 2.5D mode
	
	return back to starting area
		make it obvious to go back here, so players don't just get lost!
		maybe we can see the boss door in the distance from here?
		

Level 1 boss:
	by rotating planes, can see the "wall" blocking right of the starting area is actually just a door with no walls around it - MC can just walk around its
	
	FIGURE OUT BOSS MECHANICS!
		should involve rotating planes, possibly activating/moving lasers on both planes to corner/kill the boss?
	
	after boss fight, teleporting to space no longer makes sense if we want to use the environment/gravity to kill the last boss
		build(/repair) bridge out of boss parts to next area? 
	
	
Level 2: 2.5 D
	use similar puzzle mechanics from level 1, but add in plane-rotation as a requirement to solve all puzzles
